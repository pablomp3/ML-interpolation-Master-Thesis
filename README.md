# Variational Autoencoders for Polyphonic Music Interpolation
This is the title of my Master Thesis at National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan, July 2020)

**__Abstract__**
This thesis aims to use Machine Learning techniques to solve the novel problem of music interpolation composition. Two models based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are proposed to generate a suitable polyphonic harmonic bridge between two given songs, smoothly changing the pitches and dynamics of the interpolation. The interpolations generated by the first model surpass a Random baseline data and a bidirectional LSTM approaches and its performance is comparable to the current state-of-the-art. The novel architecture of the second model outperforms the state-of-the-art interpolation approaches in terms of reconstruction loss by using an additional neural network for direct estimation of the interpolation encoded vector. Furthermore, the \textit{Hsinchu Interpolation MIDI Dataset} was created, making both models proposed in this thesis more efficient than previous approaches in the literature in terms of computational and time requirements during training. Finally, a quantitative user study was done in order to ensure the validity of the results.
